      After releasing Mermaid, the page load times for
      <a href="http://lostmy.name/">lostmy.name</a> grew to a pretty huge sixteen
      seconds on a fast 3G connection. This is not okayâ€”this website will track
      the page load times on a fast 3G connection (both from the cache and not
      from the cache) daily so that we have a motivation to improve it, and so
      that it doesn't happen again.

      Page load time directly affects conversion.

    </strong></p>

    <p>
      We're also going to track the time until the above-the-fold (lol) content
      is all visible and usable. This is pretty subjective: the developer tools
      can't track this, so it's pretty much just me testing with a stopwatch.
    </p>

    <p>
      All tests are ran on production with the network throttling set to "Good
      3G (1 Mbps 40ms RTT)" in the Chrome development tools. The above-the-fold
      test is ran on the iPhone 6 emulator in the Chrome development tools.

    <p>
      Our target load time on a fast 3G connection without any cached content is
      <strong>7 seconds</strong>.
